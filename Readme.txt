Author: Iahn Cajigas


To install nSTAT toolbox:
1) Copy the files to the directory of your choice, e.g. c:\nSTAT\
2) Within Matlab, go the directory where you have copied the files
   e.g. >> cd('c:\nSTAT\');
3) type nSTAT_Install from the matlab command prompt
   e.g. >> nSTAT_Install
   This step adds nSTAT to the matlab search path and makes the helpfiles
   searchable along with all other matlab functions

nSTAT should now appear along with all other installed toolboxes in the
matlab help browser.
